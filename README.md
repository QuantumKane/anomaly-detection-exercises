This repo contains my work for Codeup's Anomaly Detection module.

# Some context:

- In data analysis, anomaly detection is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection)

- Anomaly detection is any process that finds the outliers of a dataset; those items that donâ€™t belong. These anomalies might point to unusual network traffic, uncover a faulty sensor, or simply identify data for cleaning, before analysis. Machine learning requires datasets; inferences can be made only when predictions can be validated. Anomaly detection benefits from even larger amounts of data because the assumption is that anomalies are rare. - [Anomaly Detection with Machine Learning](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/machine-learning-anomaly-detection/)

- Anomaly detection (aka outlier analysis) is a step in data mining that identifies data points, events, and/or observations that deviate from a dataset's normal behavior. Anomalous data can indicate critical incidents, such as a technical glitch, or potential opportunities, for instance a change in consumer behavior. - [What is Anomaly Detection](https://www.anodot.com/blog/what-is-anomaly-detection/)
