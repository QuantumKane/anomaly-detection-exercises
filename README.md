Repo for Codeup Anomaly Detection

In data analysis, anomaly detection is the identification of rare items, events or observations 
which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection)

Anomaly detection is any process that finds the outliers of a dataset; those items that donâ€™t belong. 
These anomalies might point to unusual network traffic, uncover a faulty sensor, or simply identify 
data for cleaning, before analysis. - [bmc.com](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/machine-learning-anomaly-detection/)
